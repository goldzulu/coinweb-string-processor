# Call a Contract from the Coinweb Wallet

In the previous examples we have invoked our smart contract from our web single
page dApplication. One problem that instantly strikes the eye is the part of the
offchain API code, that exposes the seed phrase. Of course this is not a valid
configuration for the real world usage, as potential bad actors would have
direct access to your private or company's wallet.

There are other ways to embed the L2 transaction without exposing the seed
phrase, but rely on the wallet of a user. For example a user could call a smart
contract with the help of our official Coinweb wallet app.

## Call the Contract by Scanning a QR Code

In analogy to the previous examples, we will compose a call operation for our
string-processor.cm. Instead of a button, we generate a QR code containing the
same template for the smart contract `CallOp`. This can be scanned with your
wallet (make sure you are on the right Network, preferably the Devnet).

## Read the Claim from the Network

Finally let us read the freshly created claim from the Coinweb network. Please
make sure the transaction has been processed and confirmed on both L1 and L2.
You can do so by checking the Coinweb Devnet explorer.
