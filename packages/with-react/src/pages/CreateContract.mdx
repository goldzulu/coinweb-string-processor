# Create a React Smart Contract

The _create_ step involves writing the code for the reactive smart contract.
This includes defining the contract, its onchain and offchain code, and any
interfaces it may emit. In this tutorial we will concentrate on Javascript
(Typescript) only. In order to create this tutorial dApp you can easily make use
of the create coinweb-dapp. In-depth explanations can be found on
[docs.coinweb.io](https://docs.coinweb.io/).

```bash
YARN_REGISTRY=https://npm.coinweb.io yarn create coinweb-dapp string-processor
```

During the prompt process you can select the `string-processor-tutorial`
template.

```bash
...
cweb-tool: What template to clone (git repo url or example)?: string-processor-tutorial
```

Alternatively you can clone the publiv repository directly:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/coinweb/ccd-examples/string-reverser-simple.git
```

After the repository was copied your project structure should look like this:

```bash
my-dapp
├── .cweb_tool
├── .cweb-config
│  ├── calls.yaml.template
│  ├── cweb-pack.yaml
│  ├── dapp-ecosystem.yaml
│  └── mnemonic.txt
├── package.json
└── packages
   ├── dapp-ui (or with-react if cloned)
   ├── string-reverser.cm
   └── string-camel.cm

```

As the final creation step you need to install the dependencies and build the
project:

```bash
yarn install && yarn build
```

All smart contracts are located in the `packages` directory under the `*.cm`
naming convention.
