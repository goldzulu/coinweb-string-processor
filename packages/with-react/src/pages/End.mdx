# Summary

In this tutorial we have learned, how to create/deploy/call a more complex smart
contract that accepts arguments and executes different methods using these
arguments - compared to our
[`hello-world` example](https://docs.coinweb.io/gettingstarted).

- We have seen several possible ways to initiate a `CallOp` to achieve the same
  outcome, by using our CLI, Coinweb's wallet app, or SDK directly.

- The onchain code consisting of multiple method handlers executed different
  string processors based on the selected method.

- We have wrapped our contract in a decentralised application with a basic front
  end, that lets a user input arguments and interact with the smart contract.

## Claims Overview

The following table displays all available claims for the current string
processor smart contract id.
