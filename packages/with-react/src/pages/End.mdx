# Summary

In this tutorial we have learned, how to create/deploy/call a more complex smart
contract that accepts arguments and executes different methods using these
arguments - compared to our
[`hello-world` example](https://docs.coinweb.io/gettingstarted).

We have seen several possible ways to initiate a `CallOp` to achieve the same
outcome, by using our CLI, Coinweb's wallet app, or SDK directly.

The onchain code consisting of multiple method handlers executed different
`StoreOps` based on the method called.

We have wrapped our contract in a decentralised Application with a basic front
end, that lets a user input arguments and interact with the smart contract.
