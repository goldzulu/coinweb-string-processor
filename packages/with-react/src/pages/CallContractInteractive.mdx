# Call the Contract from a dApp

As of now we have created a contract, deployed it via our CLI and also called it
with provided arguments from our CLI. In a lot of scenarios we likely want to
build a dApp and call a contract from our front end code, or in fact let our
dApp users call the contract with their arguments. Think a user who provides
data such as a nickname or a shipping address.

Let us assume such a scenario in which the user has control over the input
arguments.

## Call the Contract with Provided Arguments

By entering a string you want to reverse, you can preview the claim arguments as
well as the generated Call operation and the resulting prepared
TransactionMonitor. You can call the contract by pressing the call contract
button.

## Read the Claim from the Network

Finally let us read the freshly created claim from the Coinweb network. Please
make sure the transaction has been processed and confirmed on both L1 and L2.
You can do so by checking the Coinweb Devnet explorer.
