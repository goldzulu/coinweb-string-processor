# String Processor Contract Module

By convention smart contract are grouped on what in coinweb is called "contract-module". 
A contract-module is made out of two parts, the onchain code and the offchain code
The onchain part is the smart contract itself, which is registered on the
blockchain and eventually run by the coinweb runtime. 
The offchain part is the client side (or server side) code,
which interacts with the smart contract. The offchain part as a whole is not registered on
on blockchain, but a hash digest of it is stored as a file within the smartcontract, which means that 
we can use any untrusted package mirror as the source of the offchain code and still be safe
that it is the intended original code related to an specific contract-id.

## Onchain.js

Let's take a look at the onchain part of the string-processor contract-module. 
As the name suggests, the onchain part should be written in Javascript
(Typescript) and is supposed to reverse a string. Our main goal therefore is to
create a reactive smart contract that receives a string, processes it by
reversing it and finally saving it in Coinweb's claims DB.

With the help of a templating system provided by the `@coinweb/contract-kit`
SDK, we can compose the onchain part to achieve our goal in a few steps/lines of
code.

### 1: Write the string processor function

The following function receives any amount of strings or any amount of arrays of
strings as arguments, flattens them, reverses each string and finally joins them
back together into a single string.

```ts
function stringReverser(...stringsToReverse: string[]): string {
  return stringsToReverse
    .flat(Infinity)
    .map((str) => str.trim().split('').reverse().join(''))
    .join(' ');
}

function stringToggleCaser(...stringsToToggleCase: string[]): string {
  function toggleCaseString(str: string): string {
    let spacesCounter = 0;
    return str
      .trim()
      .replace(/\s+/g, ' ')
      .split('')
      .map((char, idx) => {
        if (char === ' ') {
          spacesCounter += 1;
          return char;
        }
        return (idx - spacesCounter) % 2 > 0
          ? char.toUpperCase()
          : char.toLowerCase();
      })
      .join('');
  }

  return stringsToToggleCase.flat(Infinity).map(toggleCaseString).join(' ');
}

function stringProcessor(body: string | string[]): string {
  return stringToggleCaser(
    stringReverser(...(Array.isArray(body) ? body : [body]))
  );
}
```

### 2: Write the default contract handler function

The default handler function (in this case we call it the `processStrings`
function) is the main/default entry point for the contract invocation. It
receives a context argument containing details about the transaction, provided
CWEBs for subsequent transactions (if any), the transaction itself, the provided
arguments (if any), etc.

In our case we extract Coinweb's smart contract ID and the provided arguments
from the context. Followed by some argument validation, we create a continuation
transaction which composes a generic `StoreOp` claim. The StoreOp as implicated
stores the claim in Coinweb's claims DB. After a successful invocation the
stored claim will be readable from the "outside world". All templating helpers
can be imported from `@coinweb/contract-kit`.

The `getMethodArguments` part will be explained later in this tutorial.

```ts
function processStrings(context: Context): NewTx[] {
  const { tx } = context;
  const contractId = getContractId(tx);

  const [firstPart, secondPart, body] = getMethodArguments(context).slice(1);

  return [
    continueTx([
      passCwebFrom(contractIssuer(contractId), 200),
      store(
        genericClaim(
          claimKey(firstPart, secondPart),
          stringProcessor(body),
          toHex(0)
        )
      ),
    ]),
  ];
}
```

### 3: Write the register function

The final step is to define the contract's registration step. We create a
`cwebMain` function by convention, which is the entry point for the contract
module deployment. Starting with an empty module object, we add the
`DEFAULT_HANDLER_NAME` as the convention for the default contract handler. We
can also use any other additional handlers with several other provided handlers.
In our case we also add two separate handlers for the partial processing of a
string. Later in this tutorial we will look at the additional onchain logic.

The last handler is as well a
[generic internal convention](https://docs.coinweb.io/develop/reactive-smart-contracts/contract-registration/self-register),
the `SELF_REGISTER_HANDLER_NAME`, which is the default way for registering
Coinweb smart contracts. During the registration useLinkClickHandler, if the
`SELF_REGISTER_HANDLER_NAME` is provided, the contract will be registered with
the provided handler, in this case another default `selfRegisterHandler`
imported from `@coinweb/self-register` SDK.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```ts
export function cwebMain() {
  const module: ContractHandlers = { handlers: {} };
  addMethodHandler(module, DEFAULT_HANDLER_NAME, withValidateInputArguments(processStrings));
  addMethodHandler(module, TOGGLE_CASER, withValidateInputArguments(onlyToggleCase));
  addMethodHandler(module, REVERSER, withValidateInputArguments(onlyReverse));
  addMethodHandler(module, SELF_REGISTER_HANDLER_NAME, selfRegisterHandler);
  executeHandler(module);
}
```

That is all we need for the onchain part of the string-processor smart contract
module.

You can find the full code under `packages/string-processor.cm/src/onchain.ts`.

The onchain part is not per se limited, but the bigger the file size the more
gas will be needed in order to publish and store it on the Coinweb network.

## Offchain.js

The offchain code is the part of the smart contract that is not registered on
Coinweb. Generally the offchain code provides ways to interact with the smart
contract. Nevertheless the smart contract depends on the offchain code as its
reference is used while creating a hash (=contract_id) of the contract. Meaning
changes to the offchain code will result in a new contract_id and therefore in a
new smart contract that will have to be reregister.

The offchain part will be explained part by part in the upcoming sections.
