# Call the string-processor.cm from CLI

At this point we have created a coinweb smart contract, wrote the
onchain.js code and register the contract. Now we can call the contract from the
cli (as well by utilising the `@coinweb/cweb-tool`). This section is very
similar to the [getting started section](https://docs.coinweb.io/gettingstarted)
in our official docs. Therefore we will not go into detail here, but cover the
most important parts.

What we want to achieve in this step is to invoke the smart contract in Coinweb,
which means we will call the `processStrings` function of the contract with a
set of provided strings. In the end we expect to receive the processed version
of our input back.

This will not happen in a `Request-Response` pattern as we are used to from eg.
HTTP requests. Instead we will embed a transaction in Coinweb and wait for it to
succeed on both the Layer 1 blockchain as well as on Layer 2 Coinweb, which will
execute a `StoreOp` and therefore write a claim with the result to Coinweb's
claims DB. Afterwards we will be able to read the result as often as we want.
Think of it more as a CQRS (command-query-responsibility-segregation) pattern.

## Providing Arguments

The most significant part of this contract compared to the `hello-world`
example, is the ability to dynamically provide arguments. Nevertheless we will
start with the most static but easiest way to do so, which is by hardcoding the
arguments into the YAML call config file of the contract.

### YAML Call Config

Under `packages/string-processor.cm/deploy/calls.yaml.template` you will find a
generic template for the call config file of the string-processor contract
module.

The `calls.yaml.template` looks like this:

```yaml
# this is the contract id placeholder
__CWEB_CONTRACT_SELF_REFERENCE__:
  args: {}
  cweb_provided: 80000
  auth: false
```

The `__CWEB_CONTRACT_SELF_REFERENCE__` is a placeholder for the actual contract
id and the args part is at this point an empty object. This template is being
used in order to create the actual `.calls-package.yaml` file. This generated
file will be picked up by the cweb-tool before executing the smart contract
invocation.

In order to provide arguments we can alter the `args` part. The provided
arguments must be composed in a list that follows a strict order which goes as
follows:

1. Handler that we want to execute, in our case the `DEFAULT_HANDLER_NAME`
2. First key part (in our case a constant, think table name)
3. Second key part (some arbitrary identifier)
4. Body or general arguments (the string we want to process)

The `calls.yaml.template` file should be altered to look like this:

```yaml
# this is the contract id
__CWEB_CONTRACT_SELF_REFERENCE__:
  args:
    - 'DEFAULT'
    - 'STRING-PROCESSOR-TABLE'
    - 'TUTORIAL'
    - 'STRING WE WANT TO BE PROCESSED'
  cweb_provided: 80000
  auth: false
```

As you may recall in our default handler function we access the arguments from
`context` with the `getMethodArguments` function, whereby the first argument is
sliced as it is reserved for the method handler name.

```ts
// ...
const [firstPart, secondPart, body] = getMethodArguments(context).slice(1);
// ...
```

The broader definition of a claim can be found on
[our docs page](https://docs.coinweb.io/develop/reactive-smart-contracts/develop-claims-storage).
In short a claim is a key-value pair that is stored on Coinweb's claims DB.

- First Key: Often used as the "table name" in the context of the claim.
- Second Key: Used as the "key in table", providing an additional level of
  organization within the claim.
- Body: The actual stored value of the claim.

### Executing the call

In order to execute the call we need to run the following prepared scripts, that
will utilise `@coinweb/cweb-tool` and execute the contract call:

```bash
cd packages/string-processor.cm
yarn call-contract

# ... which is the combination of the following scripts:
# "call-contract": "yarn call-contract:prepare && yarn call-contract:invoke",
# "call-contract:prepare": "./scripts/make-single-call.sh",
# "call-contract:invoke": "cweb-tool call deploy/calls.yaml ../../.cweb-config/mnemonic.txt DEVNET_L1A https://api-devnet.coinweb.io/wallet",
```
